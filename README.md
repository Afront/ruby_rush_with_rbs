# CS1632 - Software Quality Assurance - D2
Spring Semester 2019

## Deliverable 2

For this assignment, you (NOT with a partner)  will write code and unit tests for Ruby Rush, a simulator of prospectors hunting for rubies.  Be careful though, for there are also fake rubies about!

Requirements for this program are in the `requirements.md` file in this directory.  Sample output is also provided for several runs of the program.  In case of ambiguity, please see the sample output as an example of what to display and how the system should work.  Note that the sample output shows specific routes for given seeds - you do NOT have to have your seeds create the exact same routes.  They are purely for demonstration purposes.

This program must be written in Ruby and use minitest for the unit tests.  This program must use rubocop with the attached .rubocop.yml configuration and SimpleCov as described in class.
